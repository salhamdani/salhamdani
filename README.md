- 👋 Hi, I’m @salhamdani!
- 👀 I’m interested in math, both pure and applied! 
   - I earned a B.A. in Mathematics and B.S. in Biomedical Physics back in 2019, and in 2021 graduated with my M.S. in Mathematics. My thesis studied the zero distribution of Chebyshev polynomials with binomial-type coefficients.
   - As of late, I've mostly been working on applied statistics related work. 🆒
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to live my "best life" despite having relatively mediocre healthcare coverage. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects. I prefer to work on projects that will have a net positive impact on the world.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is by email (full name [at] gmail dot com); I keep notifications on social media turned off.
